# InstaBrute Two Ways to Brute-force Instagram Account Hacking

### what is a InstaBrute

### Instagram contained two distinct vulnerabilities that allowed an attacker to brute-force
### passwords of user accounts. Combined with user enumeration, a weak password policy
### no 2FA nor other mitigating security controls, this could have allowed an attacker to compromise 
### many accounts without any user interaction, including high-profile ones. 
### Facebook fixed both issues and awarded a combined bounty of $5.000.
